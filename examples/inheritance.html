        var Base = function() {
            this.x = 0;
            this.y = 0;
        };

        Base.prototype.move = function(x, y) {

        // below describes how prototypal inheritance is utilized within Spritewerk
        var Sprite = function() {
            // 1. Scoped Constructor Call
            // we call the Base constructor with the scope of the Sprite object.
            // this will run whenever an instance of Sprite is created
            // we call this here before anything else so that:
            //     - it runs whatever is needed in the Base constructor. eg. adds event listeners, gets a DOM element etc.
            //     - it applies any properties assigned in the constructor to Sprite
            Base.call(this);

            this.image = null;
        };

        // 2. Prototype Clone
        // here we make a deep copy of Base's prototype and assign it to Sprite's prototype.
        // this is often accomplished via assigning an instance of Base to the Sprite's protoype.
        // we are not using that method however, as we don't want to call the constructor while inheriting
        // there are, of course, many other ways to do this, but I am not currently interested in those.
        Sprite.prototype = SW.Common.Util.clone(Base.prototype);

        // as the above line overwrites the entire prototype, run it first, then assign your methods below.
        Sprite.prototype.assignImage = function(image) {
            this.image = image;
        };

        // instantiate and play!
        var sprite = new Sprite();
        // image: null
        // x: 0
        // y: 0
        // assignImage: function (image) {...
        // move: function (x, y) {...
