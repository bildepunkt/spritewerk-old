spritewerk
==========

### the what
spritewerk is a canvas based framework to ease and speed up the process of multi-platform html game development

### the why
spritewerk is a culmination of my own curiosity and desire to improve my skills, coupled (loosely amirite?) with my interest in producing traditional, console-style games.
